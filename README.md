### Hello, I'm Janice 👋

I'm a data scientist based in Tokyo, Japan. 

🔭 I’m currently working on writing a few blogs on SQL, Python, Tableau, Exploratory and Alteryx. 

🌱 I’m currently learning how to use GAN (Generative adversarial network) to generate images. 

😄 I'm excited about the future with AI. 

⚡ Besides coding, I bake 🍞 or take pictures 📷 of flowers 💐
